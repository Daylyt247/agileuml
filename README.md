# agileuml
This repository contains the source files for the Eclipse Agile UML project
These are the core source files of the Agile UML toolset. 
Plugins, such as the UML to C and UML to Python translators will be made available in due course, as will libraries such as ocl.c and ocl.py

The executable for the toolset is in umlrsds.jar

This can be executed as java -jar umlrsds.jar on the command line
The toolset expects a directory called 'output' to exist in its execution directory, 
'output' is used to hold all input and output files, such as metamodels and models.

Further information, and a manual for the toolset, can be found at https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/uml2web/
